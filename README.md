This folder holds all of my beginner projects that I created in order to make sure I have the fundamentals for python:

1. Password Strength Checker - A simple password checker that looks at size, memorability, and uniqueness, then offers to edit/ammend the PW to make it fit all the criteria.

- Allowed me to work on my logic (ie if statements, loop control, etc.)
- I got accustomed to new libraries and functions e.g. regex, string formatting, try/except, ValueError handling, etc.

2. Rock Paper Scissors - As the name suggests, it is Rock Paper Scissors.

- Helped me learn rule tables
- Helped me utilise lists more and formatting to aid in readability and good programming practice.

3. Number Guessing Game - Game where a random number is generated based on the difficulty the user selected, then the user must guess the number the computer has generated.

- Allows the user to customize difficulty, number of rounds, etc. 
- Helped me learn and improve on my logic, function skills, and more.
